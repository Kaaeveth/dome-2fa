# Dome-2FA
This is a two-factor authentication application for Android and Windows.
The app generates two-factor authentication (2FA) codes using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) according to [RFC 6238](https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC6238).
It supports reading QR codes using the [Google Authenticator URI format](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format), and stores accounts encrypted locally.
2FA accounts may also be created manually by entering the secret, hash algorithm and duration directly.

This is a hobby project intended for my personal use.
Feel free to use or modify this app for yourself.
