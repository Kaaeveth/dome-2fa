# Dome-2FA
This is a two-factor authentication application for Android and Windows.
The app generates two-factor authentication (2FA) codes using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) according to RFC 6238.
It supports reading QR codes using the Google Authenticator URI format (https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format).
, and it stores accounts encrypted locally.

This is a hobby project intended for my personal use.
Feel free to use or modify this app for yourself.
